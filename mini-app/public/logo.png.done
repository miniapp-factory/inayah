512x512
A stylized 2048 game board with four rows of tiles, each tile labeled with numbers 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, and 2048. The tiles are arranged in a 4x4 grid on a bright, gradient background that transitions from light blue at the top to deep purple at the bottom. Each tile has a subtle drop shadow and rounded corners, with a slight glow around the larger numbers. The overall composition is clean and modern, with a subtle vignette effect that draws attention to the center of the board. No text or logos are included.
